# Tech-Blog

## Description
I made a tech blog. Tech blogs are very good for allowing coders to communicate with each other; they can help each other with problems, and they can help teach one another different skills. Learning new things is very important in the tech world, as technology is always changing.

I didn't have enough time to figure out how to put in a blog_id for the comments.

I learned how to connect the back end of an application to the front end, and the best practises for doing so.
